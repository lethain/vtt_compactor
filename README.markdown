Script for turning VTT transcripts, e.g. those created by Zoom when you
record a meeting, into a denser format with less redundant information.
Specifically created to simplify manual editing of interview transcripts for a
project that I've been working on.

Usage:

    python3 compact.y yourfile.rtt

There are no 3rd party package dependencies.
